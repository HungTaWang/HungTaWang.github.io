    <b style="font-size: 20px;"><br><br>Welcome to my webpage!</b><br><br>
    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <p>I am Hung-Ta Wang. I hold dual bachelor’s degrees in Accounting and Industrial and Information Management from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Industrial Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU). My undergraduate training in accounting has instilled in me a meticulous approach to problem-solving and a solid understanding of business operations. Meanwhile, my studies in Industrial and Information Management provided a combination of industrial practices and information management, enabling me to transform plans into actionable outcomes. At NTU, I am conducting research on dynamic pricing at the Decision Science Laboratory, focusing on methodologies such as Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic Programming, Time Series Analysis, and Deep Neural Networks.</p>
    
    <p><b>Practical Applications</b></p>
    <p>Beyond academic knowledge, I have applied theoretical frameworks to real-world challenges. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in the NCKU Business Competition, where our team won the championship by presenting cost budgeting and marketing strategies for AKB48’s overseas expansion. As a master’s student, I competed in the Chunghwa Post Co., Ltd. Big Data Competition and won the Creativity Award and Special Award by Galaxy Software Services. Our project centered on optimizing mailbox placement, where we utilized Time Series Analysis and Nonlinear Programming to achieve a projected revenue growth of 7.5 times for newly selected locations.</p>
        
    <p><b>Personal Aspirations</b></p>
    <p>I aspire to play a positive and motivating role within a team, fostering creativity through collaboration both within the core team and across departments. With my expertise in analytics and strong interpersonal communication skills, I am confident in my ability to bring fresh perspectives, drive innovation, and enhance overall team performance.</p>
    
    <p><b>I believe that persistence and clarity of thought are key to achieving excellence and continuous self-improvement.</b></p>
