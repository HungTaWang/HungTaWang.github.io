    <b style="font-size: 20px;"><br><br>Welcome to my webpage!</b><br>
    <p>I am a former student of National Cheng Kung University and currently pursuing my studies at National Taiwan University. 
      <br>My primary objective is interdisciplinary learning, with a deep interest in the field of Industrial Engineering.</p>
      <p>My double major in Accounting and Industrial and Information Management has provided me with opportunities to develop interdisciplinary knowledge, enabling me to quickly adapt to evolving systems, requirements, and team dynamics while fostering decisiveness when needed. 
        I aspire to take on an active and motivating role, encouraging creativity within and across teams. 
        I am confident that I can leverage my subject expertise and interpersonal skills to enhance team performance effectively.</p>
        <p>Engage in fitness, basketball, and historical literature as key extracurricular pursuits to promote physical wellness and cultural enrichment. 
          These activities not only support higher productivity but also deepen my understanding of diverse perspectives, enabling more effective teamwork and collaboration</p>
      <p><b>I believe that persistence and clarity of thought are key to achieving excellence and continuous self-improvement.</b></p>
