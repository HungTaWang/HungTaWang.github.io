> This is a summary of my academic performance at NCKU.

<p>Every summer vacation has been a milestone in my university life, marking different stages of my dreams and accomplishments. During the summer after my freshman year, in preparation for future courses in the Department of Industrial and Information Management, I began to self-study programming. The sense of achievement from working hard, brainstorming, and finally arriving at the correct solution was deeply fulfilling. This effort also helped me achieve a score of 90 in the Introduction to Computers course, ranking third in my class.</p>

<p>During the summer after my sophomore year, I was inspired by my professor and deeply realized my shortcomings in English proficiency. Therefore, I joined the NCKU International English Speaking Club to practice my English speaking skills and learn to organize my thoughts better. At the same time, I started conversing with friends in English daily and watching more foreign dramas. As a result, my TOEIC score improved significantly, from 605 to 880.</p>

<p>In my junior year, I found immense joy and fulfillment in self-learning. Besides my internship during the summer, I began reflecting on what unique and distinctive skills I could develop to stand out. Combining my personal interests, I chose Japanese as my second foreign language. I started learning through the Japanese teaching website "時雨の町" and referred to recommended book lists from the internet, reading numerous resources. Eventually, I successfully passed the JLPT N3 certification exam.</p>

<p>During the summer of my senior year, I once again benefited from my professor's guidance, realizing the importance of focusing on foundational knowledge. I revisited my textbooks and enrolled in two modular courses: "Optimal Decisions – Mathematical models, Theories and Practices" and "Introduction to algorithms for nonlinear programming and their implementations". </p>

<p>All these efforts were aimed at becoming a more professional and well-rounded industrial engineering talent.</p>
