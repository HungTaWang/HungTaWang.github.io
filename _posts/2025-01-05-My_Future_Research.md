> My work at Decision Science Laboratory in Fall 2024.

<p>At the beginning of my masterâ€™s program, I decided to expand the programming skills and academic foundations I had built during my undergraduate studies. I enrolled in Linear Algebra and Its Applications to strengthen my theoretical knowledge, which introduced machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For the course's term project, I focused on Support Vector Machine (SVM), a classic and widely used approach in machine learning.</p>

<p>Additionally, I took Statistical Deep Learning, which provided me with a comprehensive understanding of various neural networks, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). These studies significantly enhanced my understanding of machine learning concepts and methodologies.</p>

<p>Moreover, based on these two courses, I have an overall comprehension of Time Series Analytics. Beyond the understanding of autocovariance matrix and models such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), I integrated RNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to achieve more comprehensive and precise predictions in time series analysis.</p>

<p>These efforts align closely with my focus on Stochastic Modeling, which I consider my area of expertise. Through literature review and discussions with my advisor, <b>I aim to combine my proficiency in accounting and industrial engineering. My current research plan involves leveraging machine learning techniques to simulate customer behavior and applying dynamic pricing strategies to optimize revenue management.</b></p>
