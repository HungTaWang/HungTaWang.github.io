> I had a speech in NCKU English Speaking Club when I was a junior.

<p>In high school, I was afraid of English, but upon entering college, I realized I could no longer avoid it. Instead of escaping, I understood that facing challenges head-on was the right approach to overcoming them. This realization led me to join the National Cheng Kung University International English Speaking Club.</p>

<p>Initially, I only planned to listen to others from the audience and practice English with friends. I was resistant to speaking on stage, fearing my limited English skills would lead to ridicule. However, I reminded myself of why I joined the club. Determined, I committed to thorough preparation and continuous practice, embracing the saying, “One minute on stage, ten years of practice off stage.” Though it required significant time and effort, this experience helped me become more confident in facing challenges, and my English skills improved rapidly.</p>

<p>As a result, I successfully hosted the Coffee Table Discussion session at the National Cheng Kung University International English Speaking Club, earning recognition from everyone for my efforts!</p>
