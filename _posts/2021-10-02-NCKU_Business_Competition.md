<p>During my participation in the National Cheng Kung University Business Competition, I was evaluated as being quick to respond and adept at adapting to changes during the practice period. As a result, I was assigned the crucial role of delivering the final summary and handling the judges’ Q&A session. Both tasks required me to adjust in real time based on the remaining time and prioritize quick thinking, reinforced through thorough preparation.</p>

<p>Our project centered around AKB48’s potential expansion into overseas markets, with our team focusing on Indonesia after researching the socio-economic conditions of several countries. During the judges' Q&A, we faced an unexpected challenge when they pointed out the low TV penetration rate in Indonesia, questioning how we could ensure the visibility of our programs to the public.</p>

<p>This question caught us off guard, but perhaps because I tend to make unconventional decisions and am more adaptable to uncertainty, I took the microphone despite feeling nervous. Drawing on my knowledge and experience, I responded that even if television was not widely accessible, an engaging program would prompt audiences to seek it out through alternative means. I emphasized that even if viewers couldn’t watch it live, discussions among friends would continue to spread awareness and interest in our content. Our new group would stimulate more engagement and discussion.</p>

<p>The judges appreciated my answer, and in the end, our team won the championship!</p>
