##### We are team "所向吳敵". 

It was my first competition during the first semester of my master's program, where our team was tasked with optimizing mailbox locations using AWS. I contributed to solving challenges in selecting revenue indicators. To address this, we focused on core factors and, after preprocessing the data, applied Multiple Regression Analysis to identify four key indicators:

- Proximity between mailboxes and metro stations
- Passenger flow at metro stations
- Number of convenience stores near mailboxes
- Age demographic structure of the mailbox's location

After establishing the revenue structure, we incorporated time-series analysis using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA model) to predict future stockout risks. Given the extensive dataset, we prioritized execution efficiency and memory optimization during programming, while also gaining practical experience in operating AWS.

Finally, we employed nonlinear programming to account for customer constraints, such as maximum travel distance and identified optimal mailbox locations as well as the least-performing mailboxes. The results showed high consistency with real-world data, and the projected shipment volume for selected locations increased by over 7.5 times compared to the original estimate.
